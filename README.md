##Review Count Distribution – Highlights frequency of review volumes per hotel.
##Rating vs Review Count – Helps identify any correlation between reviews and rating.

 ##How to Use:

##Clone this repository.
##Create a .env file and save your Google API key.
##Open the notebook hotel (1) (1).ipynb using Jupyter.
##Make sure required packages (e.g. pandas, plotly) are installed.
##Run the cells to replicate the analysis or modify for custom insights.

 #Notes:

##All interactive visualizations are saved as standalone HTML files.
##Dataset was filtered and structured before analysis.
##Future improvements may include clustering hotels or adding NLP on reviews.
